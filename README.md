## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to analyze Citi Bike data. In the end, we will use this data to pitch to different investors to try and bring Citi Bike to Des Moines, Iowa. The data we use for analysis comes from New York City Citi Bike data. Though New York is very different from Des Moines, the New York data can help us gather insights on how Citi Bike functions in any metropolitan area. By analyzing the New York Citi Bike Data, we have gained insights on usage by gender, when and how long bikes are used and investigated bike maintenance.

### Usage by Gender

The pie chart above is a breakdown of Citi bike users by gender. As the pie chart shows, males are the largest user of Citi bikes, followed by women and then Unknown in third. 

### When and How Long?

The two images above provide insights into the length of time a user uses a bike, and when during the week they use them. The line graph shows us that most users are using the bikes for short rides, typically less than an hour, with the most popular length of time being between 5-7 minutes. The heat map shows us that the most popular times for bike usage are between 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. From this we can infer that the users of Citi Bike, male or female, are using Citi Bike to commute to and from work.  


### Bikes need repairs

When Des Moines gets Citi Bike, there will be some costs to keep the service running. One of the costs will come from maintenance of the bikes. With this in mind, the two visualizations above were made. The first is an image showing all of the bikes used in new work. Bikes that are redder in color have higher usage, and therefore are in more need or repair, with the cooler color bikes not so in need. The bar chart shows the time of day that bikes are used. We can see from the chart that bikes see the least amount of usage between 2am and 5am, creating the perfect window for bike maintenance.

### Conclusion

There are several takeaways from this data. For one, both men and women use Citi Bikes, with more men using the bikes than women. Also, regardless of gender, the bikes are very popular for users to use to commute to and from work. This shows that any city with a dense enough population can benefit from Citi Bike. There are a couple of more insights that should be looked at specifically to see if Citi Bike is good for Des Moines. 
  
  - The average distance of a ride. New York is a very dense place, and itâ€™s possible that the distance needed to get to and from work is less in New York than it is in Des Moines. 
   - Bike usage by age: We should see into the age demographics of Citi Bike users, and compare those demographics to Des Moines.
